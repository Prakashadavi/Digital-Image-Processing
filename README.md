# Digital-Image-Processing
This project demonstrates grayscale image steganography using MATLAB. It embeds a secret image inside a carrier image by modifying the least significant bits (LSBs) of the carrier. The project includes both embedding and retrieval phases and showcases how visual information can be hidden in plain sight using simple binary manipulation techniques.
